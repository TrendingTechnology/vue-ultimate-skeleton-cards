# Introduction

Vue Ultimate Skeleton Cards (Or VUSC for short) is a cool customizable skeleton card plugin for VueJS. It gives you **two** ways of defining a skeleton card.  
One gives you basic customization and a *unique* structure prop.  
The other gives you complete control over the layout of your skeleton card.
